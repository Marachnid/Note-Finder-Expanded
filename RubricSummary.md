## OBJECTIVES
- Create an innovative, data-driven Java web site or application that solves a problem of interest to you.
- Demonstrate effective use of the technologies and techniques learned in the program, with emphasis on Enterprise Java competencies, including

- Authentication and authorization. At minimum, register a new user and log into the application using an identity service such as AWS Cognito,
  Google Auth, etc.
- Logging using a framework => Log4J
- Unit testing using a framework => jUnit
- Object relational mapping (ORM) framework for all database access => JPA/Hibernate
- Web service/s (at least one) consumed using Java.
- Demonstrate proper use of UI elements to create a visually pleasing, responsive application.

Create a well-structured Java project following industry best practices.
- Use version control.
- Demonstrate the ability to effectively plan project work and execute that plan.
- Demonstrate the ability to independently troubleshoot and debug.
- Document the process and progress of the project.
- Articulate the application architecture and explain the technologies used.


## DELIVERABLES
- Problem statement, user stories, and project plan (detailed schedule for your project). Must be approved by instructor.
  Screen design and application flow.
- Complete at least 2 design/code reviews with at least 2 peers and the instructor.
- Regular (minimum of weekly) reflection statement documenting progress and time spent on the project and course work.
- Source code, HTML JavaDoc and all supporting materials, e.g., design documents, published on GitHub.
- Deploy the application to a publicly accessible location, i.e., hosted on AWS.
- Present completed project to the class. Demonstrate the application, explain the application architecture
  and discuss significant technical aspects of the project with emphasis on your independent research technology.
- Video demonstration of the completed application - a link to the publicly accessible video in your project readme.md in GitHub.


## CHECKPOINTS
- Checkpoint 1:
    - Problem statement, user stories, project plan, screen design and reflection statements pushed to GitHub.
    - Be sure to identify which stories are part of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
    - Link to your repository here. Week 4.
- Checkpoint 2:
    - Database designed and created, at least one DAO with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) implemented with Hibernate.
    - DAO is fully unit tested, Log4J is implemented (no System.out.printlns). Week 7.
- Checkpoint 3:
    - Deployed to AWS, at least one JSP that displays data from the database is implemented, authentication implemented.
    - Add link to your deployed application here. Week 9.
